# BoidsEnvironmentSimulation
## Description
The project, in its simplicity, is an extension of the boids algorithm to construct a fish-like ecosystem and simulate natural selection and reproduction. 

The boid (bird-oid) algorithm is a common artificial life program that simulates complex flocking behavior in birds and fish (think that tuna scene from Finding Nemo) and runs on three distinct rules:
1. Cohesion: Boids will move towards the average position of the flock
2. Separation: All boids will avoid colliding into other boids and steer away
3. Alignment: Boids of a flock will align themselves in such a way that all boids (ideally) move in the same direction

The combination of these three simple rules can create some advanced behavior, such as in the photos below (taken from my project)
